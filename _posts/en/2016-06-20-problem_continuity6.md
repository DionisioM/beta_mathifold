<div>
Study the continuity of the following function: <br><br>

$f(x) = \sqrt{x+2}Â·\arccos(x+2)$<br><br>

<div class="bcblue boxdissap">
Solution
</div><br>

<div class="dissap">
We know that $f(x)$ is a product of a square root and a arccosine. For the first function, we know that the thing inside the root must be greater or equal to zero and for the second one, the value of the arccosine must be between -1 and 1 ($[-1,1]$).<br><br>
Therefore, we need to solve the following equations:<br><br>

$x+2 \geq 0$<br><br>
$x+2 \geq -1 $ and $x+2 \leq 1$<br><br>

From the first equation, we know that $x\geq -2$ <br><br>
From the second equation, we get that $x\leq -1$ and $x\geq -3$.Then, $x\in[-3,-1]$.<br><br>

Finally, by doing the intersection of both intervals, we get that $f(x)$ is continuous when $x\in[-2,-1]$.
