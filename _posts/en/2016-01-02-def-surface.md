A **surface** is a topological space $$S$$ locally homeomorphic to $$\mathbb{R}^2$$, that is, for each point $$p\in S$$ there exists a neighborhood $$U$$ and a homeomorphism $$\phi:U\longrightarrow V$$ where $$V\subset\mathbb{R}^2$$ is open

(we may impose $$V=\mathbb{R}^2$$, it is enough to restrict to a ball centered in the target point, which is homeomorphic to the whole $$\mathbb{R}^2$$)
